## What is this application?
Application where you can easily create your own sound quiz and share it with friends or guess other users' quizzes.

## Why this project was created?
I got inspired by <a href="https://vg-sfx-quiz.herokuapp.com/">Video Game SFX Quiz<a> when I was playing with my friends. We liked it but didn't find another one, so I created an application where the users can easily create an SFX quiz.
  
## Some technical info
- I wanted to practice .NET MVC with razor pages and this time I created the app using just it. There was not too much JavaScript and components, Angular wasn't necessary.
- For simplicity, I used ASP.NET Core scaffolded Identity and just change it a little bit. For now, I resigned with an email-sender, email confirmation, and authenticating via external services(Facebook, Google, etc).
